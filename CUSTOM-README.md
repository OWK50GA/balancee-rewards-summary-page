Rewards Summary Page created for Balancee, as part of their requirements for employment.

### *Project Description:*

Company Statement:

  Our company is excited to announce a new task for aspiring ReactJS interns interested in creating a valuable feature within our [Balanceè platform](https://customer.balancee.app/). The focus of this task is to develop a Rewards Summary Page where customers can track their earnings, view their cashback history, and cash out their rewards, either directly or through promo codes. Customers earn 1.5% of their total booking amount whenever they make bookings on the customer dashboard and the task is to develop a page where all their earnings would show.
  
  ### *Task Objective:*
  
  The goal of this task is to design and develop a ReactJS component for the Rewards Summary page. This page will allow users to:
  
  1. Track their earnings from bookings made through the [Balanceè platform](https://business.balancee.app/).
  2. View a history of their cash back transactions.
  3. Cash out rewards either directly or by applying promo codes.
  4. Use dummy data where applicable, mock JSON response and focus on writing maintainable code.
  5. Make sure the UI looks good and you can use animations
  
  ### *Key Components of the Rewards Summary Page:*
  
  1. *Earnings Overview:*
      - Purpose: This section gives customers an overview of the total rewards or cashback they have earned through their bookings.
